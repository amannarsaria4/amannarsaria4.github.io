I am currently studying financial engineering at UC Berkeley. I am interested in the field of quantitative research and to make sense of complex data simple simple and intuitive models.

Before deciding to pursue my masters in this field, I worked at Dolat Capital(high-frequency trading) where I made systematic trading strategies for futures trading in the Indian stock market. Prior to this, I worked at a JP Morgan Chase as a Quantitative Reseacher intern for the equity derivatives group. I worked specifically on using numerical methods to price exotic options contracts.

I graduated with M.Sc. in Economics and BE in Computer Science from BITS Pilani in 2023. 

When I get too overwhelemed with my work, I usually run( literally !). I love to go on long distance runs to clear my mind. I also like to cook when I get time. 


Thanks
