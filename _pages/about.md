I am currently pursuing my Masters in financial engineering at UC Berkeley. I am interested in the field of quantitative research. I graduated from BITS Pilani, India with a dual major in M.Sc. Economics and B.E. Computer Science.
<!-- I like to build simple and intuitive models that can make sense of complex data.  -->

Currently I am working on an Open Range Breakout strategy for FTSE futures, and exploring how various indicators can be used to improve profitability. 

Before deciding to pursue further studies in this field, I worked at Dolat Capital, where I developed systematic trading strategies for high-frequency futures trading in the Indian stock market. Prior to this, I was at JP Morgan Chase, where I worked with the Equity derivatives group(EDG) as a Quantitative Reseacher intern, focusing on pricing exotic options using numerical methods.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing all kinds of sports. I usually challenge myself and push my limits by going on long distance runs (if all goes well, I plan to run the NYC marathon this year). I also like to cook new things whenever I get time. 

If you are interested in knowing more about any of my project/would like to discuss new ideas, feel free to drop an email.
