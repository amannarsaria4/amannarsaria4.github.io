My name is Aman Narsaria, a financial markets enthusiast, aspiring chef, avid runner and student at UC Berkeley. Welcome here!

I am currently pursuing my Masters in financial engineering at UC Berkeley. I am interested in the field of quantitative research. I like to think mathematically and statistically and build models to price/trades various financial instruments. I graduated from BITS Pilani, India with a double major Economics and Computer Science.
<!-- I like to build simple and intuitive models that can make sense of complex data.  -->

Currently I am working on an Open Range Breakout strategy for FTSE futures, and exploring how various indicators can be used to improve profitability. 

Before deciding to pursue further studies in this field, I worked at Dolat Capital, where I developed systematic trading strategies for futures trading in the Indian stock market. Prior to this, I was at JP Morgan Chase, where I worked with the Equity derivatives group(EDG) as a Quantitative Reseacher intern, focusing on pricing exotic options using numerical methods. 

Outside of work, I enjoy playing all kinds of sports. I usually challenge myself and push my limits by going on long distance runs (if all goes well, I plan to run the NYC marathon this year :) ). I am also learning wind surfing and I usually like to cook new cuisines on weekends and try to experiment with different food items. 

Interested in knowing more about projects, or would like to discuss new ideas? Feel free to drop an email at aman_narsaria@berkeley.edu
