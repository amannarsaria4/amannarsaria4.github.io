This is my very biased, very personal list of places where I *actually* enjoy running in New York. Not “I ran because I had to” runs. These are “I forgot I was tired” runs

1. **West side highway**:
Absolutely goated. No notes. Every run here feels elite. The energy is unreal — runners, cyclists, walkers, dogs living their best lives. Somehow you always end up running one extra mile because everyone else is. The Hudson views do most of the mental work for you. Only downside: it can get crowded, but honestly, that’s part of the vibe.

2. **Central Park**:
If NYC had a reset button, this would be it. The outer loop and the reservoir are my favor-routes. I try to make it here at least once a week in the summer, usually when I need to disappear from the city without actually leaving it. Ending a run at Sheep Meadow, lying on the grass, questioning life choices — unmatched.

3. **Fifth Avenue**:
This one’s for slow, chill runs where pace absolutely does not matter. Running past flagship stores feels oddly motivating. I usually end at Washington Square Park — perfect for cooling down, people-watching, and convincing myself I’ve earned a coffee (Tartinery never disappoints).

4. **Brooklyn Bridge (the right way)**:
Early (5:30 AM) morning only. My favorite route starts at Tompkins Square Park, crosses the Brooklyn Bridge (time sunrise), and finishes in DUMBO. The views hit different mid-run, and ending in Brooklyn always feels like a small accomplishment, even if the pace wasn’t Strava-worthy.

5. **The 'Let’s Just Explore Run**:
Okay this is not a route - its more of a personal note. Some days I don’t pick a route at all. I choose a neighborhood, keep Maps open, and start running. I bookmark cafes, restaurants, parks — anything interesting. No pace goals, no distance pressure. Just curiosity, movement, and accidentally discovering new favorite spots.
